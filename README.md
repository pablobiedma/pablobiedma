When I was in highschool, I used to make movies as a hobby. I would write screenplays, call some friends, start recording, and edit everything. What I realized is that as much as I loved movies, I liked creating something new, something from scratch and on my own. That is the reason why I started programming.

Skills: Java / Python / JS / SQL / C++
